  \brief This module contains all code of the ui.
  The UI component is responsible for the user interface and the interaction with the user.
  The UI is developed in the Qt-framework, yet the `mapview'(used in the overview and configuration screen) is based on a rewritten version of the Qt MapKit library.
  The rewritten version combines both C++ and Javascript code.
