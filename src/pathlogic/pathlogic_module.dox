  \brief The PathLogic component is responsible for calculating the paths of the drones.
  
  At the moment, two implementations of PathLogic algorithms are implemented, one for a rectangle search area, and one for a polygon area.
  The PathLogic component supports multiple drones and can easily be expanded to other algorithms.
